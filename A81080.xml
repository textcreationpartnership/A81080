         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>XX. <hi>Portia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cato,</hi> and Wiſe of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Brutus,</hi> when ſhe conjectured by the fleepleſs, and diſturbed nights of her Huſband, that he had conceived ſome great thing in his mind, and concealed it from her in ſuſpition of her weakneſs; ſhe to give her Huſband an inſtance of her Conſtancy and Secrecy, made her ſelf a deep wound in her Thigh with a Razor; upon which there followed a ſtream of blood, weakneſs; and a Feaver. When <hi>Brutus</hi> came home, ſad at ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected an accident, and all being withdrawn, <hi>Sit down Huſband</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I have ſomething ſerious to diſcourſe with you; when I married you, I came to your Houſe as a Wife, not as a Miſtreſs, or Whore, nor only as a Companion of your Bed, and Board, but of all proſperous and adverſe things; I am</hi> Cato<hi>'s Daughter, and reckon you that I am of that blood, what then, do I complain of you? Not at all, if I look at other matters, Conjugal Solemnities, good will, and this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal love; but I look higher, and would have your Friendſhip al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and that is the only grief of my mind which torments me, that you have my fidelity in ſuſpicion, for wherefore ſhould you diſſemble; do I not perceive the care you are in? Thae there is ſome ſecret, and great enterprize you are in agitation about? Why do you conceal it from me? If I can lend you no aſſiſtance, expect ſome comfort at leaſt from me; for as to my ſecrecy I am able to ingage; conſider not the reſt of my Sex; I ſay again, that I am the Daughter of</hi> Cato, <hi>and</hi> I <hi>add thereunto that I am the Wife of</hi> Brutus, <hi>either nature, being from ſuch a Father, or Converſation with ſuch a Huſband, will render me conſtant and invincible againſt all that is to be feared; why do I multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply words, I my ſelf have made experiment of my ſelf, and ſee this wound which of my own accord I have given my ſelf, that I might know whether I could undergo with Courage any grief and torments, I now fully believe that I am able to bear them,

to deſpiſe them, and I, my</hi> Brutus, <hi>can die with, and for my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; if therefore you are about any thing that is juſt and honourable, and worthy of us both, conceal it no longer, Brutus</hi> admiring the greatneſs of her mind, and ſurprized with the diſcovery of ſuch great affection, lifting up his hands for joy, burſt out into theſe expreſſions, <hi>O all ye Powers above,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>be ye favourable, and propitious to my deſires, and make me a Huſband that is worthy of</hi> Portia; then he recited in order to her the Conſpiracy for killing <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar</hi> in the Senate Houſe, and who were concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein; wherewith ſhe was ſo far from being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, or diſſwading him from it, that ſhe incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to proceed; but the day on which they were to perform the Enterprize, ſhe being in fear for <hi>Brutus,</hi> ſwooned away, and was ſcarcely recovered by him; at the laſt <hi>Brutus</hi> being overcome, and ſlain at <hi>Philippi,</hi> ſhe determined to die, &amp; when her Friends, who were ever with her to prevent it, deprived her of the opportunity and means, ſhe at laſt ſnatched the burning Coals with her Hands out of the fire, and thruſting them into her mouth, ſhe kept them there till ſhe was choaked. Of this Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for the Readers better underſtanding it, I ſhall make a brief digreſſion. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Brutus</hi> (faith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) was deſcended from <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> as great an enemy to Kings as he was to Tyrants; he was well beloved by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſo that he gave order for his ſafety at the Battle of <hi>Pharſalia</hi> as for his own Son; he moved nothing but what was honeſt and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, ſo grave and conſtant he was; he carried what he moved, ſo reſolved was he; after <hi>Caeſar</hi> had paſt the <hi>Rulicon</hi> contrary to the Decree of the Senate, and had ſo overpowered them, that he was choſen perpetual Dictator, and had thereby taken away the liberty of the Commonwealth, <hi>Brutus, Caſſius</hi> &amp; ſome others conſpired againſt him; <hi>Brutus</hi> hated the Tyranny, and <hi>Caſſius</hi> the Tyrant; <hi>Brutus</hi> was incenſed againſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> Empire by his Anceſtors Enterprize againſt Kings, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples expectation from him, for under their Images they writ, <hi>O that</hi> Brutus <hi>were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

At firſt the multitude abhorred, and were amazed at the Fact, but afterwards they applauded it, when they ſaw that neither power nor ſpoil was the deſign, but honeſt Liberty, yea, the Senate entertained, ſecured, honoured &amp; imployed them in ſeveral Provinces, particularly <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Creet:</hi> who committed two Faults; firſt, in ſaving <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> their cloſe Enemy, and next in publiſhing <hi>Caeſars</hi> popular will, and ſolemnizing his Funeral, at which <hi>Anthony,</hi> by his Speech, and ſhewing <hi>Caeſars</hi> bloody Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inraged the multitude ſo far, that <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Friends retired to <hi>Athens,</hi> for fear of <hi>Gaeſars</hi> Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and there got as many <hi>Romans</hi> together, as he could prevail upon, with whom he reſolved to try his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, affirming, <hi>That he would either die, or live with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and rid his Country of Bondage by Battle, or himſelf by death;</hi> Here <hi>Caſſius</hi> met him with more Forces, and as they were about to paſs their Army toward <hi>Rome,</hi> an horrible Spectacle is ſaid to appear to <hi>Brutus;</hi> for in the dead of the night, when the Moon ſhined not very bright, and all the Army was in ſilence, a black Image of an huge and horrid Body appeared to <hi>Brutus,</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſilent by him, his Candle being almoſt out, and he

grown greater than his Fortunes, he was forſaken even by his own Brethren, yet then was he received into the Houſe of his only Friend <hi>Barbadicus,</hi> who was a very noble and rich Perſon, and had before lent him four thouſand Duckets <hi>gratis;</hi> which debt he forgave him as ſoon as he entred his Houſe, he alſo paid for him two thouſand more, which he had contracted with others, and after this, by an extraordinary and irrevocable act of his own, he made him Overſeer, and Adminiſtrator of all his Goods moveable and immoveable, in ſuch manner that he might diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure; nor was <hi>Barbadicus</hi> ſatisfied with this, but that he might provide for the benefit of his Friend, he leaves it in his Will, that though he had a Wife and Brother, yet <hi>Trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanus</hi> ſhould be his ſole Executor, that he ſhould have the whole power of diſpoſing his Daughters in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, nor ſhould he at any time be compelled to render an Account of his Truſt, or of any thing pertaining to that Eſtate; he alſo bequeathed him a Legacy as large as his Eſtate would permit, without apparent prejudice to the Fortunes of his Children; <hi>Barbadicus</hi> was moved to do all this, becauſe he perceived <hi>Triviſanus,</hi> as ſoon as he had entred his Houſe, by a ſingular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of mind, of a prodigal of his own Eſtate, became ſparing of anothers, and from that moment had left off all Gaming, and other ſuch pleaſures of youth, he had alſo betaken himſelf to the company and converſe of learned and wiſe men, and by addicting himſelf to the peruſal and ſtudy of the beſt Authors, had ſhewed him, that he would anſwer his liberality with ſincerity, uprightneſs, and unblameable fidelity, which fidelity <hi>Barbadicus</hi> had often before, and alſo ſince this liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his experienced in him his beloved and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Friend, when he alone defenced the life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Barbadicus</hi> in his greateſt ſtreights, and worſt dangers, as well open as concealed, ſo that he openly profeſſed to owe the ſafety of them both to <hi>Triviſanus;</hi> the whole City knows how he ſupported the innocency of his Friend in the ſalfe and deviliſh Calumnies that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:172234:40"/>
were raiſed upon him, and would not deſert him in the worſt of his Fortunes, though he was ſlandered for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his part; while he did this, he not only interrupted the courſe of his preferments to the chiefeſt places of Honour in his Country, into which to the amazement of all men, he was in a moſt hopeful way; but he alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited and loſt all thoſe opportunities. It is alſo well known to all men, that he contracted great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enmities with ſome that had been aforetime his Companions, upon the ſole ſcore of this Friend of his; he deſpiſed all that extrinſick honour which depends upon the opinion of the brutiſh multitude, and at the laſt expoſed his own life to frequent, and manifeſt haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, as he would alſo yet do in any ſuch occaſion as ſhould require it, and whereas <hi>Triviſanus</hi> hath lived and is yet alive, and through the incomparable expreſſion of a grateful mind in <hi>Barbadicus,</hi> he lives with great ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and in great Authority. He is merciful to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, courteous to his Friends, and is eſpecially a moſt worthy Patron of all thoſe that are virtuous; he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably eſteemed by the Daughters of his Friend, in ſuch manner, as if he were their own Father; he is alſo chearfully received by his Wife, and truly honoured by her as her Brother as well becauſe ſhe is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his merits in reſpect of her Huſband, as alſo for his excellent temper, and ſuch other uncommon quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as render him worthy of the love and admiration of all men. <hi>Hakewils Apology.</hi> p. 439.</p>

The Emperor <hi>Trajan</hi> returning from the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, when he came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> he commanded a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory Sacrifice to be made to the Heathen Gods for his good ſucceſs, at which <hi>Ignatius</hi> was required to be preſent, but he even before <hi>Trajans</hi> face did juſtly, and truly reprove his Idolatry, for which cauſe he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to ten Soldiers, by them to be carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be caſt to the wild Beaſts; concerning which, himſelf thus writes; <hi>From</hi> Syria, <hi>till I came to</hi> Rome, <hi>I had a battel with Beaſts, as well by Sea as by Land, night and day, being bound among ten Leopards</hi> (ſo he called thoſe ten Soldiers) <hi>who the more kindneſs they received from me, the more cruel they were unto me; but now through exerciſe I am well acquainted with their injuries, and am taught every day more, and more, to bear the Croſs of Chriſt; would to God I were once come to the Beaſts that are prepared for me, and I wiſh that they may fall upon me with all their violence; whom alſo I will provoke without delay to devour me, and not to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from me, as they have from many before me. Pardon me I pray you, I know how much this will turn to my advantage, I am Gods Corn, and when the wild Beaſts have ground me with their Teeth, I ſhall be his Whitebread; now I begin to be a Diſciple of my Maſter Chriſt, I neither regard things viſible; nor inviſible, ſo I may gain Chriſt, let the fire, the Croſs, the breaking of my Bones, quartering of my Members, cruſhing of all my Body, yea, and all the Torments that the Devil and Man can invent, fall upon me ſo I may enjoy my Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
